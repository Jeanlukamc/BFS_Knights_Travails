# BFS_Knights_Travails
Breadth First Search algorithm on the Knight's Travails Problem

- This implementation creates an 8x8 grid, replicating a chess board, where a knight piece and a random end position are placed among said grid.
- The goal is to use the Breadth First Search algorithm to find the most optimal path for the knight to reach the end goal with the least amount of moves possible.
- Print the results and see the how the knight moves with the found optimal path.

- Uses this pseudo code as a template and implement it in Java
